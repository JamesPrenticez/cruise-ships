It is actually a measure of the total inside volume of a ship that is used for charges, like going into a port or travelling through a canal (eg Panama Canal ). The measurement includes the engine room, bridge, accomodation, room for cargo . One Gross Ton is equal to 100 cubic feet or about 2.83 cubic metres.'

        title: 'Length: ',
        desc: 'This is the total length of the ship. Sometimes some vessels have what is called a bulbous bow (which bulges under the water).

It is important to note that some ships have what is called a bulbous bow under water at the bow which you cannot see and this can extend past the top bow which you would be able to see. While quite a lot of ships don't have bulbous bows, taking this measurement in a drydock can get around not seeing the whole length of the ship when it is in water.",
